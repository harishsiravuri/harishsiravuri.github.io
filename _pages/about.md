I am a Computer Science researcher working on the application of machine learning and natural language processing techniques in the field of bibliometrics.

My research addresses challenges with the traditional document-centric scholarly communication. I study the evolution of the publication of scientific literature and the challenges that come with the ever increasing volume of scientific knowledge. I investigate these questions and address these challenges by using advances in machine learning techniques and natural language processing to convert unstructured data in open access publications into machine actionable knowledge graphs.

I have also been working as a data scientist since 2018 using machine learning to solve business problems in multiple domains.

Key words:
Machine Learning; Natural Language Processing; Data Mining; Deep Learning; Bibliometrics
